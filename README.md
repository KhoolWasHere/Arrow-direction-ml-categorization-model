# Arrow direction ml categorization model
This is a categorization model made in python that can diffrentiate between simple ms paint drawings of arrows and wehther they are pointing up or down.
This project consists of two scripts, one that trains the ai and exports the model to a .pkl file and the other that takes that .pkl file and uses it to tell where an arrow is painting.
